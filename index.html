    <h2><u>Literals</u></h2>
    <p>
        In Java, <strong>literals</strong> are fixed, constant values represented directly in the source code.
        They are not variables or expressions but rather the raw values themselves that are assigned to variables or used in expressions.

    <h2><u>Arrays</u></h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Arrays</strong> in Java are fundamental data structures used to store a fixed-size sequential collection
        of elements of the same data type. This means an array can hold multiple values of the same type
        (e.g., all integers, all strings) under a single variable name.

    <h2><u>Identifiers</u></h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Identifiers</strong> in Java are names used to identify various programming elements such as
        classes, methods, variables, packages, and interfaces. They are essential for uniquely identifying and
        referencing these components within a Java program.

    <h2><u>Class</u></h2>
    <p>
        In Java, a <strong>class</strong> is like the bamboo forest shown below—a unified structure from which many identical yet unique elements (objects) grow.
        Each bamboo stalk resembles a Java object, created from a common blueprint. Just as the forest stands strong and organized with each stalk in place,
        Java programs are built from classes that define object behaviors and properties in an organized way.
